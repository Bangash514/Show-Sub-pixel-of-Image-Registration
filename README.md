# Show-Sub-pixel-of-Image-Registration

Details:
Sub-pixel image registration is a technique that enables the alignment of two or more images with high accuracy. It involves finding the precise alignment of the images at sub-pixel level. In C++, you can achieve sub-pixel image registration using the OpenCV library. Here is an example of how to perform sub-pixel image registration using OpenCV in C++:
